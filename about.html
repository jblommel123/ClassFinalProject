        <h3 class="video-title">Assetto Corsa Competizione</h3>
        <p>ACC is the official GT3 World Challenge game. This game is one that can make you feel completely immersed into what is going on.</p>
        <p>The sound design in this game is the closest to what the real cars sound like in any racing simulator. I have been to several GT3 races before and if I wasn't looking at a game I would think it was the real thing.</p>
