        <h2>Assetto Corsa Competizione</h2>
        <p>ACC is the official GT3 World Challenge game. This game is one that can make you feel completely immersed into what is going on.</p>
        <p>The sound design in this game is the closest to what the real cars sound like in any racing simulator. I have been to several GT3 races before and if I wasn't looking at a game I would think it was the real thing.</p>

        <h2>iRacing</h2>
        <p>iRacing is the 800lb gorilla of the sim racing genre. They have every major series within their lineup.</p>
        <p>Want to race NASCAR? Go for it. Want to race IndyCar? Go for it. Sports car GT racing? They have it. Multiclass? It's there. Dirt Racing? Yes. It has the most complete collection of racing content that exists. They aren't the best at simulating one thing, but do everything well. They are the jack of all trades and the game is like getting 10 regular racing games.</p>
